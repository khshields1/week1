3 step process to manage files with git:

1. Modify the file - use nano to open the text editor and input information
2. Stage the file - notify git that you intend to commit a version of the file by typing git add .
3. Commit the file - tell git to store the file in the staging area to a git repository by typing git commit -m 'input a description of the changes made'
